Bathroom visions. 

Briefly. 

Everything that has touched this planet since its creation, all technologies are available. 
We can see them. Our body allows it. 
Moreover, the human psyche, brain + emotions + energy layers that are activated by emotions, all this is unable to create anything new. Nothing at all. 
Then the logical question is where it all comes from. That's exactly where we, as it seems to us, succeeded, tried to open the door. 
That is, the viewing function is available, you can pause, turn, look inside, but there is no manual on how to create it. 
That is, we visually see something and try, on the basis of what we know, to recreate what we saw. That's about it. 
Thus, with the help of a bath of visions, any technology is available. 

It is called a bathroom because the first prototype was assembled on the basis of an ordinary steel bath, the second on the basis of a plastic one. 

The experiments were carried out in Russia from 1993 to 1999. 

However, the best place to experiment is +/- 10 degrees from the equator.
