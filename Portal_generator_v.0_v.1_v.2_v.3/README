Briefly. 

Many parallel worlds are in the same time and even in the same place. 
In some places, the separation layer ranges from a few millimeters to several centimeters. 
In some it can be measured in tens of kilometers. 
The nearest reality to us is still inhabited by pterodactels, possibly dinosaurs, while there are speculations that visually this is the same planet 
but with some differences. 
The opening of the portal is possible and real. 
We opened a portal 1.7x1.7 meters (Panama 2013), and we saw a pterodactyl nest, with 2 birds and their mother, 
who apparently tried to protect the chicks to penetrate our reality. 
By the way, in the USA not so long ago, around the 30s, a pterodactyl was shot that ate sheep. 
We can tell exactly where it came from and guess how it got here. 
The application is simple. 
For example, we know exactly the environmentally friendly technologies for mining and exploration methods, 
moreover, we have a record of where, when and what was mined, you can try to repeat it there, 
of course, studying pterodactyls in their native environment is more interesting, but less commercially profitable.

The experiments were carried out in Russia from 1989 to 1992 and in Panama in 2010 and 2013. 
The best place to experiment is +/- 10 degrees from the equator.
